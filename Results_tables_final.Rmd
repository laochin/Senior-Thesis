## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
merged_data <- merge(RDOE_board, wpaoe_board, by = c("offensive_coach", "season", "posteam"))
merged_data <- merge(merged_data, PATrdoe_board, by = c("offensive_coach", "season", "posteam"))
final_data <- merge(merged_data, PATwpaoe_board, by = c("offensive_coach", "season", "posteam"))

# Assuming final_data is your merged dataset
# Remove columns ending with .y
final_data <- final_data[, !grepl("\\.y$", names(final_data))]
# Assuming final_data is your merged and cleaned dataset
final_data$WPAOE_all <- final_data$total_wpaoe + final_data$total_PATwpaoe

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
str(final_data)
```




```{r}
# Assuming final_data is your complete merged and cleaned dataset

# Loop through each season from 2014 to 2023 and create a separate dataset
for (year in 2014:2023) {
  assign(paste(year, "final_data", sep = "_"), final_data[final_data$season == year, ])
}

```


```{r}

# Assuming final_data is your data and teams_colors_logos is your logos dataframe
# Let's do it for the 2014 season as an example

# Merge with teams_colors_logos to get the team wordmarks/nicknames

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
